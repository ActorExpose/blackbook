**blackbook** is a historical (black)list of malicious domains created as part of the hourly automated heuristic check (i.e. WHOIS, HTTP, etc.) of newly reported entries from [CyberCrime](https://cybercrime-tracker.net/) in search of those that are/were malware **dedicated** (e.g. C&C). It is supposed to be used for detection of malware infected clients by inspection of associated DNS traffic with significant reduction of false-positive findings.

List of domains can be found [here](blackbook.csv).
