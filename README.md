**blackbook** is a historical (black)list of malicious domains created as part of the hourly automated heuristic check (i.e. WHOIS, HTTP, etc.) of newly reported entries from public lists of malicious URLs (e.g. [CyberCrime](https://cybercrime-tracker.net/) and [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)) in search of those that are/were malware **dedicated** (e.g. C&C). It is supposed to be used for detection of malware infected clients by inspection of associated DNS traffic with significant reduction of false-positive findings.

Up-to-date list of domains can be found [here](blackbook.csv).
